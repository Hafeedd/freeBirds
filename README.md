<h3>The academic project, â€œFREE BIRDS (SYSTEM FOR MANAGING ORPHANS) has the idea of
what the title itself says. This project will provide help for orphans, semi-orphans, and
street people. For this a platform is created which includes different organizations and these organizations help these people through the system. This system is aimed at the
protection of these people. Find out these people and provide food and dress and education.
This system is helping these people by developing their knowledge and protecting their
health and also giving others help these people.
  <br><br>
The core part of the project is a method for managing orphans in a distributed
transaction system. This method ensures that orphans cannot observe inconsistencies and that
orphans are eventually eliminated. For that, the admin can Register organizations and
manage them. Organizations can register services, sponsors, and inmates and 
provide educational information and awareness to public users. Organizations can report
missing children and view the case status so they can update the status of the case and they
can identify the missing child technically. Donors register themselves and they can donate
things. Our system deals with missing child identification. For this, a deep learning model is
trained to correctly identify the missing child from the missing child image database
provided, using the facial image uploaded by the public. We use the Amazon rekognition
feature to detect the matching images on this website. Using Amazon rekognition the image is
saved as a face print of the image in the amazon s3 bucket and the face print of the searched
image will also be made to search for the matching image from the s3 bucket.
